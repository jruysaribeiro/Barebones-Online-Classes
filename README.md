# Barebones-Online-Classes
A generic barebones platform for you to sell video classes and lessons online

Frontend using ejs (Embedded Javascript), HTML and CSS (Bootstrap 4 Library).
Backend using NodeJS.
Database with MongoDB.

This platform as I built it is already up and running. As things stand I use Vimeo as a video server and Imgur as an image server. I will first upload all current working code and then start developing and working with whatever APIs exist to implement an upload strategy adaptable to whatever video and image server you wish.
